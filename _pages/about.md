## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) (started from Feb 2023). I am supervised by A/Prof [Christoph Treude](https://ctreude.ca/) and Dr. [Mansooreh Zahedi](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=-mrcwTwAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on supporting developers in documentation maintenance and knowledge acquisition in both traditional and AI-based software systems. I am particular interested in using **qualitative methods** to empirically understand issues and phenomenons in the software ecosystems from the lens of both software artefacts and developers, as well as building automated pipelines using **machine learning methods**.

Before starting of my Ph.D, I obtained my Master’s degree in Information Technology from the University of Melbourne, Australia, and my Bachelor's degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Fuzhou University, China.
