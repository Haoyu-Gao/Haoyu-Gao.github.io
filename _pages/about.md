I am currently a first-year PhD student at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) (started from Feb 2023). I am supervised by Dr. [Christoph Treude](https://ctreude.ca/) and Dr. [Mansooreh Zahedi](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=-mrcwTwAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interest lies in applying both empirical and automated techniques in analysing and improving software documentation contents and activities.

I have attended several prestigious international conference including ICSE and ESEC/FSE. My work has been published in ESEC/FSE'23.
