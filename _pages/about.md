I am currently a third-year PhD student at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) (started from Feb 2023). I am supervised by A/Prof [Christoph Treude](https://ctreude.ca/) and Dr. [Mansooreh Zahedi](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=-mrcwTwAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on supporting developers in documentation maintenance and knowledge acquisition in both traditional and AI-based software systems.

I have published research works in several prestigious venues such as TSE, FSE, and ESEM.
